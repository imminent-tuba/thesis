# Imminent Tuba Thesis Project!

### Chat Bot Data Visualization
Talk to our chatbot and our website will update live with data based on the conversations you hold with it.
Our chatbot will be found on Slack and possibly Facebook Messenger.

### Installation
```
python setup.py develop
```

### Usage

### Contributing
To start the server using the babel transpiler and nodemon, run
```
$ npm run start
```
The front end code is packaged with webpack. It is nice to have two terminal windows open with nodemon
running in one and webpack running in the other. This way you can see errors in either process.  
To start webpack, run
```
$ npm run webpack
```
