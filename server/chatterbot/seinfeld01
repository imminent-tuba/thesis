"I think it would be not being able to tell if there was bugs in my food.",
"How could you ever enjoy a meal like that? I'd constantly be feeling around with my lips and my tongue.",
"Well, that's how my 5yearold eats.",
"He's a very picky eater.",
"Hear about that kid that was kidnapped the other day in Pennsylvania? No.",

"Right.",
"Your friend Roy.",
"What's the name of this physical therapist? I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything about her kid.",
"She's a little off.",
"And you don't have to pay? We have 3:00 appointments.",

"Then I took my pants off.",
"You took your pants off? For my hamstring.",
"He got about two inches from there.",
"Really? I think it moved.",
"It moved? It may have moved.",
"I don't know.",
"I'm sure it didn't move.",
"It moved! It was imperceptible, but I felt it.",
"Maybe it just wanted to change positions.",
"You know shift to the other side.",
"No, no.",
"It wasn't a shift.",
"I've shifted.",
"This was a move.",
"Okay.",

"Well, maybe he likes Dinky Doughnuts.",
"I don't like to sit next to men on airplanes because our knees might touch.",
"I can't see Joe DiMaggio sitting at the counter at little, tiny, filthy, smelly Dinky Doughnuts.",
"Why can't he have a doughnut like everybody else? He can have a doughnut, but not a Dinky.",
"I don't even like to use urinals.",

"I'm not working.",
"I can't afford that.",
"I don't know how I feel about it.",
"Oh, what are you, like a Quaker now? All right, all right.",
"A stall man, huh? So we were wondering if it was possible for you to write us a note.",
"And if you can't, believe me, it's fine.",
"He didn't say he can't.",
"lf you feel funny about it at all.",
"He doesn't feel funny.",
"lf he does.",
"Do you feel funny? Forget it.",
"He didn't say anything.",
"He feels funny.",
"You don't have to do this.",
"He knows that! Should we go? Is this a breach of our friendship? Oh, can you be any more dramatic? Don't be ridiculous.",
"Holyfield.",
"He's a good friend of one of my patients.",
"He's got a hell of a body, doesn't he? How would I know? Do you like him? What do you mean, like him? Do you like him? Well, I mean, he's a good fighter and a nice guy, but I don't like him.",

"I sat down here first.",
"Hey.",
"I saw DiMaggio in the doughnut shop again.",
"Yeah.",
"Joe DiMaggio? Joe DiMaggio.",

"I studied his every move.",
"For example, he dunks.",
"Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts? That's right.",
"See, now I know it's not him.",
"Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.",
"Oh, he's a dunker.",
"Why couldn't he be a dunker? Nothing diverts his attention.",
"Like, I'm sitting in there, you know and I start banging on the table so that he'll look up.",
"Like I'm sitting there, and l He wouldn't move.",
"So then I started doing these yelping noises, like: No reaction, because the guy is so focused, you see.",
"He can just block out anything that's going on around him.",
"See, that's how he played baseball.",
"He dunks like he hits.",
"So then what? Well then the waitress, she comes up and she tells me to shut up or they're gonna throw me out.",
"Why didn't you just call out his name? What happened to you? These kids called me a Mary.",
"A what? I was jumping over a puddle.",
"For some reason, I went like this: And they called me a Mary.",
"So I chased them and I tripped and I fell.",
"Yeah, you know kids.",
"They can be very perceptive.",
"Hey, George.",
"What is this? What is that? No, really.",
"What is that? Hello.",
"Oh, hi, Roy.",
"What? Oh, my God.",
"How did this happen? What can I do? I am so sorry.",
"Okay.",
"Bye.",
"That was Roy.",
"He's under investigation for insurance fraud.",
"I told you.",
"Told me what? I told you we shouldn't do it.",
"I didn't say anything.",
"He's got a house, a family.",
"They could take away his license.",
"Three notes.",
"How stupid was that? We never should've got three notes.",
"Three notes? Yeah.",
"You, me and George.",
"You got me a note? Yeah.",
"But I got my own note.",
"You what? I got a note from my gynecologist.",
"Why'd you do that? I didn't know you'd get me a note.",
"Of course I'd get you a note.",
"You didn't say anything.",
"Neither did you.",
"That's how he got caught.",
"We sent in four notes from two doctors.",
"How could you do that to your friend? He's got a wife, kids and a lot of other stuff.",
"Oh, yeah.",
"Hi, Pam.",
"Hello.",
"Hello.",
"I just thought maybe I could talk to Roy if Pam, did the xray from Mrs.",
"Sloane? Hi.",
"Hi, Roy.",
"How you doing? Come on back.",
"I have a patient, but she's under.",
"I don't even know what to say.",
"Me neither.",
"I knew this would happen.",
"Me too.",
"I mean, the whole thing, it's just.",
"Tragic.",
"Well, it's not tragic.",
"No? No.",
"It's.",
"Unsettling? Okay.",
"I mean, what if they? I hope you're both happy.",

"Yeah, college was fun.",
"You know the whole practice is in jeopardy.",
"You know that.",
"Don't mind her.",
"Oh, please.",
"I love her.",
"I've just met her, but I'm very impressed.",
"I've never had a problem with these notes before.",
"What's gonna happen now? Nothing, as long as we get the physical therapist to go along with our story.",
"What? The physical therapist? Why? She has to say the complaint was related to a dental problem.",
"How you doing? Hi.",
"Look, I know I don't have an appointment but it's really important that I talk with Julianna.",
"I'm sorry.",
"She's not in.",
"I know she's mad at me, but I really have to speak with her.",
"I told you she's not here.",
"Look, you have to leave.",
"Wait a second.",
"Don't you? Hi.",
"Look, I don't know what you think Please.",
"But, you see.",
"Let me talk to you for a second.",
"What I did is inadvertently I treated you, so please just get out of the office.",
"Can't you listen to me? Run, Billy! Run to the office and close the door.",
"Call the police.",
"The police.",
"What is the? Hi, George.",
"Hello.",
"Raymond? Well, I mean, it's only a sixmonth probation.",
"It's a slap on the wrist.",
"I still don't see any dinner invitations forthcoming.",

"All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.",
"Of what? And a guy will appear from out of nowhere.",
"I said, Get out of here.",
"What do you want? You don't belong here.",
" What do they do? They talk back.",
"They go, Hey, George, how's it going? I said, Get the hell out of here.",
" Hey, it's the KMan.",
"Maybe it's time you got a different hobby.",
"Oh, man.",
"Just came from Roy's.",
"I threw up from the gas.",
"Did he say anything? No, no.",
"He's fine.",
"Oh, my God.",
"It's.",
"What? Joe DiMaggio.",
"Having a cup of coffee.",
"And he's dunking.",
"Yeah.",
"Look at him.",
"The Yankee Clipper.",
"Here.",
"You see? Now, that is a handsome man.",
"Oh, please.",
"Wait.",
"Hold on a minute.",
"Wait.",
"See? I told you.",
"What causes homophobia? What is it that makes a heterosexual man worry? I think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance.",
"We're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.",
"Men think, Obviously, I can be talked into anything.",
"What if I accidentally wander into some sort of homosexual store thinking it's a shoe store, and the salesman goes: 'Just hold this guy's hand, walk around the store.",
"See how you feel.",
"No obligation, no pressure, just try it.",
"Would you like to see him in a sandal?"]
